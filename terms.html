<h2>General Disclaimer</h2>

Everything on this site is provided "AS IS" without any warranty of any kind, but every effort has been made to ensure

<h2>Privacy</h2>

This site does not use ads, cookies, or any form of visitor tracking (but see the disclaimer about third party services
below). No personal data is collected or stored (except if the user chooses to provide such data via the feedback form).
